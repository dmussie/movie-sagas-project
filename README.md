# Project Name

Movie Sagas Project

## Description

For this application, I had a host of data of several prominent movies, stored in a number of tables within a database, that needed to be rendered on the DOM for viewing. I also needed to establish a method for a user to add a movie on the client side to be stored in this database along with these original movies.  

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
